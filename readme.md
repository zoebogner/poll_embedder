## Poll Embedder 0.1 alpha 2012-07-22
Tested in **Elgg 1.8.8**

`Please note` this is early alpha testing stuff. Best not to use this for anything mission critical.



Poll Embedder allows users to embed polls from PollDaddy.com (and eventually other services too) using their supplied Wordpress shortcodes. The plugin doesn't make changes to user content, it simply intercepts it on its way to the view to show the embedded poll.

This plugin has been adapted from Ray J's Embed Extender plugin. The plugin, nor myself, are affiliated with Polldaddy, Wordpress, Elgg, etc.
