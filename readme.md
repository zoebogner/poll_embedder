## Poll Embedder 0.1.2 2012-08-25 RC1

Tested in **Elgg 1.8.8**

Poll Embedder allows you to embed Polldaddy Polls and Ratings into Elgg using Wordpress shortcodes.

### Usage

To install the plugin, rename the plugin folder to **poll_embedder** and place it into the /mod/ directory of your Elgg site. Then activate the plugin from your Elgg site's plugin administration screen.

To insert a Polldaddy poll or rating, simply paste the WordPress share code from Polldaddy into the text field of your post. The WordPress share code for a Polldaddy poll looks something like this:

> &#91;polldaddy poll="1234567"&#93;

### Supported polls

* Polldaddy Poll
* Polldaddy Rating

*I hope to add support for more poll types and providers in the future. If you have a request, please post it to the project's [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/zoebogner/poll_embedder/issues).*
