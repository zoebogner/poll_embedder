### Acknowledgements

This plugin was inspired by Ray J's [Embed Extender plugin](http://community.elgg.org/plugins/787632/1.8.2/embed-extender), and excellent launch point for anyone wanting to learn more about developing Elgg plugins.

Neither this plugin nor the developer is affiliated with Polldaddy, Wordpress, Elgg, etc.
